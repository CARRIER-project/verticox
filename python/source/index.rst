Welcome to verticox+'s documentation!
=====================================
This repository contains the components for running vertical cox proportional hazards analysis in a
setting where the data is vertically partitioned.

The solution is based on the Verticox algorithm from
`Dai et al., 2022 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9076318)>`_. It has been adapted to be used
within the `Vantage6 <https://vantage6.ai>`_ framework.

This solution will be extended with the scalar vector product protocol to solve certain privacy concerns
in "vanilla" Verticox.
