# verticox

# N-party-scalar-product-protocol
We are going to enhance the verticox algorithm by applying the n-party scalar product protocol to the 
components of the verticox algorithm that require querying which samples have a matching event time.

These are the components:

<!-- ## $\sum \limits_{n \in E} \mathbf{x}_{nk}$ (for datanodes)$
Where $E$ is the collection of samples that are NOT right-censored.

## $\sum \limits_{j \in R_t} exp(K \overline{z}_j)$ -->


## Python version
Follow the [README](python/README.md) in the `python/` directory.
