# Architecture

The most convenient way to run verticox is using the vantage6 framework, although it is possible to
run it without it.

The architecture of verticox+ includes both components written in Java and Python. The Java components
encompass everything related to the n-party scalar product protocol. In contrast, the Python components
are responsible for coordination and the rest of the verticox+ algorithm.
